# Apology for Incorrect Repository Link

Hello FutureSoft,

I am writing to sincerely apologize for the confusion caused by my earlier mistake. I mistakenly provided the link to this repository in place of the repository of Job Management Portal.

Please refer to the correct repository link here: [Correct Repository Link](https://github.com/omsingh32123/Job-Management-Portal)

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding.

Thank you,
Om
